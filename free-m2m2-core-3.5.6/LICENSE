1. Your relationship with Infinite Automation
1.1 Your use of Infinite Automation�s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the �Services� in 
this document and excluding any services provided to you by Infinite Automation under a separate written agreement) is subject to 
the terms of a legal agreement between you and Infinite Automation. �Infinite Automation� means Infinite Automation Software Inc., whose principal 
place of business is at 4383 N 119th St Lafayette, CO 80026. This document explains how the agreement is made 
up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Infinite Automation, your agreement with Infinite Automation will always include, at a minimum, 
the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the �Universal Terms�. 

1.3 Your agreement with Infinite Automation will also include the terms set forth below in the Infinite Automation Mango Automation 
Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal 
Terms. All of these are referred to below as the �Additional Terms�. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these 
will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Infinite Automation 
in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, 
this legal agreement is referred to below as the �Terms�.

12. Copyright and trade mark policies
12.1 It is Infinite Automation�s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable 
international intellectual property law and to terminating the accounts of repeat infringers. 

13. Changes to the Terms
13.1 Infinite Automation may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to time. When these changes are 
made, Infinite Automation will make a new copy of the terms available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.

13.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms or Additional 
Terms have changed, Infinite Automation will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.

14. General legal terms
14.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your use of the Services) use 
a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use 
of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person 
concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

14.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Infinite Automation and govern your use of the Services (but 
excluding any services which Infinite Automation may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace 
any prior agreements between you and Infinite Automation in relation to the Services.

14.3 You agree that Infinite Automation may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, 
regular mail, or postings on the Services.

14.4 You agree that if Infinite Automation does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms 
(or which Infinite Automation has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of 
Infinite Automation�s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Infinite Automation.

14.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is 
invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining 
provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

14.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Infinite Automation is the parent shall be 
third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely 
upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other 
person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.

14.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Infinite Automation under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Province of
Ontario without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Infinite Automation agree to submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts located within the Town of Boulder, Colorado to resolve any legal matter arising from the 
Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Infinite Automation shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an 
equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

15. Additional Terms for Extensions for Mango Automation
15.1 These terms in this section apply if you install modules on your copy of Mango Automation. Modules are small 
software programs, developed by Infinite Automation or third parties, that can modify and enhance the functionality of Mango 
Automation. Modules may have greater privileges to access your computer, including the ability to read and modify your 
private data.

15.2 From time to time, Mango Automation may check with remote servers (hosted by Infinite Automation or by third parties) for 
available updates to modules, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality.

15.3 From time to time, Infinite Automation may discover a module that violates Infinite Automation developer terms or other legal 
agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Mango Automation will periodically download a list of such modules from 
Infinite Automation�s servers. You agree that Infinite Automation may remotely disable or remove any such module from user systems in its 
sole discretion.

16. Additional Terms for Enterprise Use
16.1 If you are a business entity, then the individual accepting on behalf of the entity (for the avoidance of doubt, 
for business entities, in these Terms, "you" means the entity) represents and warrants that he or she has the authority 
to act on your behalf, that you represent that you are duly authorized to do business in the country or countries where 
you operate, and that your employees, officers, representatives, and other agents accessing the Service are duly 
authorized to access Mango Automation and to legally bind you to these Terms.

16.2 Subject to the Terms, and in addition to the license grant in Section 9, Infinite Automation grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable license to reproduce, distribute, install, and use Mango Automation solely on machines intended for 
use by your employees, officers, representatives, and agents in connection with your business entity, and provided that 
their use of Mango Automation will be subject to the Terms.
