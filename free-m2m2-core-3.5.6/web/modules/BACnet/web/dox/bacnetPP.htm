  The <b>Network number</b> is the number of the network in which the device for the BACnet object is found. A value of 
  0 indicates the local network. The <b>MAC</b> is the id of the device within the network. <b>Link service</b> is the
  MAC of the device that acts as a router to other networks if this device for the object is foreign to the local 
  network. If the device is on the local network, this value can be empty. The <b>Device instance number</b> is the 
  BACnet inter-network unique identifier of the remote device.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Object type</b> is the type of object from which values will be requested. The <b>Object instance number</b> is 
  the unique identifier of the object/type from which values will be requested. Points request the <i>present value</i> 
  of an object instance.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Use COV subscription</b> determines whether Mango will attempt to subscribe to COV events for the object on the 
  device. Not all objects support COV subscriptions, and not all devices support them even on objects that normally 
  would. Moreover, some devices limit the amount of concurrent COV subscriptions they will accept, so no guarantees can
  be made that COV reporting will be established at runtime.
</p>
<p>
  Use <b>Settable</b> to determine whether the interface will allow users to enter value with which to update the 
  object. Only "output" values are considered to be settable.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Write priority</b> determines the priority to use when sending a write command to the object.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Data Type</b> field determines what Mango data type the point will have. Values returned from the BACnet 
  network will automatically be converted to the required type.
