<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Local device</b> is the device that should be used for connecting to the local network. Local devices can be
  defined in system settings.

<p>
  A published point's <b>Object Type</b> is the type of BACnet Object to be added to the local device and made available to the network.
  An input type is not settable, while a value type is (and will only be available if the point is settable). Multistate points can be
  published as analog values or inputs because there are restrictions upon the structure of a well-formed BACnet multistate value, such
  as restricting values between 1 and the number of states. To address this incongruence with Mango's notion of multistate value, a multistate
  value with a plain rendered is supposed to have Interger.MAX_VALUE states for maximum range. However, a multistate point with a multistate renderer
  will be most like a BACnet multistate object, where the number of states is defined in the text renderer and only values between 1 and that count of
  states (inclusive) are valid values for the point to have. If published as an Analog Value, set values are cast to integers before being set to
  multistate points.
