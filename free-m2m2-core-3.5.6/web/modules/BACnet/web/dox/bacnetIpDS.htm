<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The BACnet I/P data source is used to gather data from BACnet I/P compatible devices accessible over an I/P network. 
  Equipment can be in a local network or intranet, or could also be anywhere in the internet. This data source uses both 
  polling and COV (Change Of Value) subscriptions for updating as applicable.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the BACnet equipment is polled for data. Polling is only used if a desired object does not support COV subscriptions. 
  The device is automatically queried for its supported services to make this determination.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Local device</b> is the device that should be used for connecting to the local network. Local devices can be
  defined in system settings. See <a href="http://infiniteautomation.com/wiki/doku.php?id=datasources:bacnet:configuring_local_devices" target="blank">here</a>
  for additional details.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>COV lease time</b> is the number of minutes that Mango will request to hold a COV lease. Mango will 
  automatically attempt to refresh its COV subscriptions after half of the given time has elapsed. So, if the least time 
  is 60 minutes, Mango will request the device honour the lease for 60 minutes, and will resubscribe after 30.
</p>
<p>
  Where COV subscriptions are not available, polling at the given rate is used instead. Devices are polled individually. 
  Devices that support ReadPropertyMultiple requests are sent this message, partitioned to contain no more than 200 
  properties in a single request if necessary. Otherwise, individual ReadProperty requests are sent.
</p>

<h1>BACnet I/P discovery</h1>
<p>
  Devices on BACnet networks can be discovered automatically by broadcasting WhoIs messages. Devices are required to 
  respond with an IAm message, which contains some basic information about the device. To test configuration settings 
  and determine what devices are available for points, enter the <b>Port</b> number to which to broadcast and click the 
  "Send WhoIs" button. (If the port number is not provided, the value from the configuration is used.) A single WhoIs 
  message will be sent, and then the device will listen for IAm messages indefinitely. (Clicking "Cancel" will stop the 
  listener.) As IAm messages are received, information about the devices will be displayed in the table below button. 
  The information can be used for the creation of points.
  
  After discovery is complete it is possible to download a spreadsheet for all discovered devices, just point your browser to:
