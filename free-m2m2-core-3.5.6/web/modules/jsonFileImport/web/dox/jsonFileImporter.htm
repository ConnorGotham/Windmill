<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The JSON File Importer periodically searches the file immediately inside a supplied file path and attempts to import any and all
which begin with the specified prefix. After import, it renames the file so as not to import it again. The mechanism is the same 
as the import/export tab in Mango, but serves the purpose of importing configurations automatically such that multiple access points 
can be easily updated through a service placing files on the file system. The output usually pushed to the import/export page is
placed into a file prefixed with "log_". <b>To disabled checking and import</b> set the update periods to zero (0).</p>
<p>If a file fails to be renamed, the runtime will record that file name internally as something not to import a second time (for 
performance reasons). If the system is reset, this list is cleared. It can also be manually cleared using the button on the configuration 
page. Every poll the importer consults its list of failed renames and attempts them again.</p>
