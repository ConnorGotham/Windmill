<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Meta data source is so named because it is able to combine
	existing points into new points. Rather than deriving its information
	from an external source, it uses the values of other points, allowing
	them to be manipulated in arbitrary ways.</p>

<h1>JavaScript / ECMAScript</h1>
<p>
	This data source requires some knowledge of JavaScript, also known as
	ECMAScript. (The full specification for ECMAScript is available <a
		href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"
		target="_blank">here</a>.) JavaScript is arguably the most popular
	scripting language in use today, it being the only language available
	for use in every popular web browser. The result is that, by far the
	common usage of JavaScript is in web pages. The context within the Meta
	data source is of course different, there being no "window" or
	"document" objects, among other more subtle differences. Contextual
	differences aside, a full and complete implementation of ECMAScript is
	available within this data source. Specifically, the <a
		href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" target="_blank">Rhino</a>
	implementation is used.
