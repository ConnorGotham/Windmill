<h3>MVEL Scripts</h3>
<p>As of Meta Data Source 2.0.0, support for the MVEL language is included as a less powerful but much faster alternative to using JavaScript. The MVEL scripts 
do not currently accept functions to be performed upon the values. Rather, you may use the Var name directly (so if you point is var name p1, just use p1 in the script) 
within the script to reference it's most recent value only. The intention of MVEL scripts is to enable much faster simple computations for live data. The language guide 
for MVEL can be found <a href="http://mvel.codehaus.org/Language+Guide+for+2.0">here</a>.</p>
