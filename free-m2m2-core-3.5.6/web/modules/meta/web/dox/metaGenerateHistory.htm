<h1>Generating History for Meta Points</h1>

<p>When generating the history for a point one can choose how Mango will fill in missing values.</p>

<p>When generating data it is important to remember the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point values cannot be generated prior to the earliest value in the <b>Script context</b></li>
    <li>Point values cannot be generated after to the oldest value in the <b>Script context</b></li>
    <li>Generating a history for a point that already has values may result in duplicate point values</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Selecting Dates</h2>
<p>The <b>from date</b> is the earliest date that data will be generated for. This date is pre-set to the earliest point value in the context.
 If a selected date is prior to the earliest context point value, then the earliest context point value is used instead.</p>

<p>The <b>to date</b> is the latest date that data will be generated to.  This date is pre-set to the earliest date where there is no data for a point.
  If a selected date is after the latest context point value, then the latest context point value is used instead.</p>


<h2>Duplicate Point Values</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of data storage used for point values it may be possible to generate duplicates.  For instance, SQL type data stores allow 
multiple entries at the same time, whereas NoSQL time series data stores do not.  If you are using SQL data storage be cautious when generating history. 
It is advisable to purge your point history prior to generating if you do not want duplicate values stored.</p> 

<h2>Calls to set</h2>
<p>Calls to the set() functions on context points will result in the data being stored at the timestamp set but will not result in anything
being transmitted by the data source as a normal set in the regular course of a running meta point does. Set values do not respect logging type
and are simply saved to the database.</p>
