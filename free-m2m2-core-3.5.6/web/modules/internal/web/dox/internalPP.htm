<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Internal data points can be created to monitor specific values that monitor the internal workings of Mango Automation.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Point values to be written - the number of point values queued up waiting to be dumped to the database</li>
  <li>Point value write threads - the number of threads concurrently write point values from the queue</li>
  <li>High priority work items currently running - the number of currently executing high priority tasks</li>
  <li>Medium priority work items - the number of queued Medium priority work items</li>
  <li>Currently scheduled high priority work items - the number of High priority tasks that are scheduled to run in the future</li>
  <li>Maximum thread stack height - the largest thread stack for all threads within Mango</li>
  <li>Active thread count - the total number of active threads</li>
  <li>Active database connections - only useful if using JDBC Pooling, the active connections in the pool</li>
  <li>Idle database connections - only useful if using JDBC Pooling, the idle connections in the pool</li>
  <li>Writes per second during database batches - the number of point values going into the database per second if there are values queued</li>
  <li>JVM free memory - the amount of memory left before the heap will attempt to grow.</li>
  <li>JVM used memory - the current amount of memory being used by the JVM.</li>
  <li>JVM max memory - the maximum amount of memory that the heap can potentially acquire.</li>
  <li>JVM available processors - the number of CPU cores that the JVM can access.</li>
</ul>
