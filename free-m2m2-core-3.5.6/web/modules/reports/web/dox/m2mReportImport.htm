<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  M2M Report instances can be migrated into Mango using this tool.  Any settings that were not included in the M2M reports
  will use the default values.  Reports depend on Users, Mailing Lists and Data Points and as such any references by a 
  report must be present in Mango for the report to be imported.
  
  There are 2 ways to migrate reports across: <b>Migrate Now</b> or <b>Generate JSON</b>.
  
  Both methods require a connection to the M2M database.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Driver class name</b> specifies the Java class that implements the JDBC Driver interface within your JDBC 
  driver. This value can be found in the documentation for your driver. The following is a list of driver class names 
  for the given database, and is provided as convenience only. Note that connectivity typically requires the 
  installation of driver software on the Mango server.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MySQL</b>: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</li>
  <li><b>Oracle thin driver</b>: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</li>
  <li><b>Derby</b>: org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</li>
  <li><b>H2</b>: org.h2.Driver</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Connection string</b> depends both upon the database you are using and the specifics of its installation. 
Your JDBC driver documentation will explain how to derive the value for your database. 
The <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> fields provide the necessary credentials for your 
database to accept connections from this application.</p>


<p><b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> are the database user's login credentials.</p>


<h1>Migrate Now</h1>
<p>
  Migrate now requires that all Users referenced by reports exist in Mango.  This means that the username must be the same 
  in both M2M and Mango.  Migrate now also requires that all Data Points referenced by the reports be present in Mango.  This means that 
  the XIDs for the points be the same in both M2M and Mango.
</p>
<p>  
  Migrate now extracts the reports from M2M and the converts them by cross checking the references in Mango.  If everything checks out 
  the reports will be saved into Mango.  If there are any problems then no reports will be imported into Mango and a list of problems will be displayed.
</p>

<h1>Generate JSON</h1>
<p>
  Generate JSON does not verify any links for the Users or Data Points and makes it easier to extract the reports.  The user is then expected to manually 
  ensure that all Users, Mailing Lists and Data Points exist in Mango prior to importing the JSON.
</p>
<p>  
  Generate JSON outputs JSON formatted like the current Mango reports module expects but only uses the information 
  available from the M2M instance.  So all XIDs and Usernames are pulled directly from the M2M instance.
