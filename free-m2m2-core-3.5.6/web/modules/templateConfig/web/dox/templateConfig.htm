<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Template Configuration module is designed to make creating model configurations, 
used multiple times with slight modification, easy. Simply annotate a Json configuration, 
run the included python script, place the generated template into the web/ftl folder, and 
launch the module.</p>
<h2>Using the Templates</h2>
<p>Use the <b>Import Template</b> button to begin the import dialog. Every field from the template file is 
read and displayed with certain identifying information in the form: "Property Name - Message" with information about 
how that field spatially related to any static content in the template. If it says field, the template has no static value 
for that property. If it says prefix, the template contains static content that will come after the entered value. Suffix 
similarly refers to preceding static content. Body means there is static content on both sides. Globals do not offer information 
about their locations, as they may appear in differing situations throughout the ftl but all correspond to a single input.</p>
<p>Once your fields are filled, use the <b>Import</b> button to begin the import process. You should see the results 
of your dynamically populated import right on the page. If there are errors, don't worry, the dialog will remember 
the values you've entered if you attempt to re-open the same template.</p>
