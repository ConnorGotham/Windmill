<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The EnvCan data source pulls data from the Canadian Weather service's API based on station ID. The best method of resolving
station IDs may be unknown, but one method is to navigate to http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html
and search for a location. Select it, then, find the "StationID=" component of the URL.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The data source will only advance time if it found temperature data for the station it is polling. This means it can
become stuck if it begins polling for data before there is data. <b>Data start time</b> can be set by the date input. Data
start time applies when any point on the data source has no history when polling beings.</p>
