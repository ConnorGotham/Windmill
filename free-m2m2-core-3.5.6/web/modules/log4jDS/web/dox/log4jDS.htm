<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Log4j data source is used to store log messages from the Log4j logging system. When the data source starts an asynchronous
  logging appender is added to the root logger to intercept messages.  This happens in a separate thread as to not slow down the system.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Message repeat interval (ms)</b> is a delay on handling the same
  log message as the preceding within the interval. If a different log message occurs or the interval elapses after the first message, the second
  identical message will be handled by any points it matches. This is primarily to prevent the simplest log message infinite loops.
