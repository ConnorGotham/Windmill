<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Log4j points can be created to monitor specific log levels that are available in logging output. Each point is assigned a level of message to log 
  and optionally can filter the saved messages by a matching regex expression. Note that matching implies matching the entire message, so to search
  for a string in the center of a log message one would have .* on the beginning and the end of the pattern.
  
  <b>NOTE: </b> the log message format is exactly the same as what you see in the Logging Console UI of Mango
