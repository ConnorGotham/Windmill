<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This data source is used to collect generic information from emails received at a given POP3 mailbox. The messages in the mailbox can have been received from any source. Using mechanisms similar to an email client, the data source connects to the POP3 mailbox and individually processes the messages found there. Messages are deleted after processing. Regular Expressions are used to extract the desired information. This is a polling data source.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Inbox check period</b> determines how often the mailbox is checked for messages. The <b>POP3 server</b> is the domain name or IP address of the server that hosts the mailbox. The standard POP3 port 110 is used to connect. The <b>Inbox username</b> and <b>Inbox password</b> must be provided for access.</p>

<p>The <b>Test content</b> area is where sample email content can be put to test a point's RegEx. See the "POP3 point properties" documentation for more information.</p>
