<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Point links are used to update target points based upon the value of source points. They keep two points in "sync", 
  according to an optional transformation formula that can be defined. Practically speaking, point linking can be used
  to read the values in one system (from one or more data sources) and immediately set the values in another system
  (to one or more data sources).
</p>
<p>
  Point linking can also be achieved by using a change or update event detector on source points, and then creating an
  set point event handler for each to have the value set in a target point. However, point linking serves this purpose
  better for a few reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Point links do not raise events, creating less system overhead, and so result in better performance</li>
  <li>Point links allow for an optional script to be defined that can transform the source value in arbitrary ways</li>
  <li>The point link interface is contained in a single page, making them much easier to set up</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> point links can be set up such that infinite loops of setting can occur. Mango will detect such loops at
  runtime, stop the propagation, and raise a recursion failure event.

<h1>Point link list</h1>

  To add a new point link, click the <img src="modules/pointLinks/web/link_add.png"/> icon. To edit an existing link, click the link's 
  description in the "Point links" list.

<h1>Editing point link details</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Export ID</b> is the value used to identify the point link across multiple Mango instances. It is used by the
  Import/Export facility. This value must be unique among point links. A unique and random value is automatically 
  generated, but it can be changed to be more intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Source point</b> is the point that will be monitored for value. It is the point <i>from</i> which values come.
</p>
<p>The <b>Target point</b> is the point that will be set with values. It is the point <i>to</i> which values go.</p>
<p>
  The <b>Script</b> is an optional value that will transform the source value as necessary. More information on 
  scripting can be found in the Mango JavaScript documentation, linked in the 'related items'. The context variable name 
  for the source point is "source". So, a script such as "return source.value / 2;" will set the target point with half the 
  value of the source point. The target point is available in the context as "target". Note that
  data type transformations can also be done, such as "if (source.value &gt; 0) return true; return false;", which would
  convert a numeric source value to a binary target value. Use the <img src="images/accept.png"/> icon to validate your
  script (the source point must be available / enabled, the target point must be enabled if referenced in the script body). 
  During runtime, both the source and target points must be enabled.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Event</b> determines if the target point is set whenever the source point is updated (i.e. receives a new 
  timestamp but not necessarily a new value), or only when it is changed (i.e. receives a new timestamp and value).
</p>
<p>
  A point link can write an annotation along with the point value so that the values set by point links can be 
  distinguished from values set otherwise. This may not be necessary - in particular if the point link is the only set
  point source for the point - so this functionality can be disabled by unchecking <b>Write annotation</b>. Because
  the writing of annotations is overhead (albeit small), this should disabled if not needed.
</p>
<p>
  A point link can be <b>Disabled</b> so that it does not run. This can be useful if you do not wish to delete the 
  link, but also do not currently want it enabled.

  To save a point link, click the <img src="images/save.png"/> icon at the top right. To delete an existing link, 
  click the <img src="images/delete.png"/> icon.
