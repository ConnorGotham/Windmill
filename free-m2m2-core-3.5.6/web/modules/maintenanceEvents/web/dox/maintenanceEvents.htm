<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Maintenance events are used to schedule maintenance periods for data sources, such that events raised by the data 
  source or its points during the period are "suppressed", meaning that the events' event handlers are not run and it is 
  automatically acknowledged. When the maintenance event becomes active, a single event is raised. This event is 
  deactived when the event returns to normal or is manually disabled. Note that maintenance events can also be manually 
  activated and deactived as necessary.
</p>
  
<h1>Maintenance events list</h1>
<p>
  To add a new maintenance event, click the <img src="images/add.png"/> icon. To edit an existing maintenance event, 
  click the event's description in the "Maintenance events" list.
</p>

<h1>Editing maintenance event details</h1>
<p>
  The <b>XID</b> is a unique identifier for the event, which is used in the import/export function. It can have any
  value that is unique among maintenance events up to 50 characters long. It is defaulted to a value that is - at the
  time of generation - already unique.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Data source</b> is the data source to which the maintenance event applies.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Alias</b> is an optional value that will be used as the description for the event throughout the system if it 
  is provided. Otherwise, the automatically generated description will be used.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Alarm level</b> determines whether the maintenance event raises an alarm when active, and if so the severity 
  of the alarm. See the general help page for information on Alarms.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Schedule type</b> determines the basis period of the event. These types include hourly, daily, etc. For 
  example, a schedule type of hourly will run once every hour. If a schedule that runs, say, twice a day is needed, it 
  is necessary to define two daily scheduled events, one for each time. It is however possible to define a cron pattern 
  that runs multiple times within a period. (See the "cron pattern" documentation for more information.)
</p>
<p>
  A maintenance event can be <b>Disabled</b> so that it does not run. This can be useful if you do not wish to delete 
  the event, but also do not currently want it enabled.
</p>

<h1>Active/Inactive times</h1>
<p>
  The fields available for editing active and inactive times depend upon the schedule type chosen. Most fields should 
  require no explanation beyond that they are exclusively based upon the Gregorian calendar. For more information on 
  cron patterns, see the "Cron pattern" documentation.
</p>
<p>
  Active/inactive times can straddle the given time period. For example, an hourly schedule can become active at 55:00 
  and inactive at 05:00 (thus active for 10 minutes). Note that it is possible, though not very useful, to define cron 
  patterns that do not neatly activate and inactivate (i.e. they may activate multiple times before inactivating and 
  vice versa).
</p>

<p>
  To save a maintenance event, click the <img src="images/save.png"/> icon at the top right. To delete an existing 
  event, click the <img src="images/delete.png"/> icon.
</p>

<h1>Manual control</h1>
<p>
  To manually enable a maintenance event, click the <img src="modules/maintenanceEvents/web/hammer_deactivated.png"/> 
  icon at the top right. To manually disable an active maintenance event, click the 
  <img src="modules/maintenanceEvents/web/hammer_activated.png"/> icon. Note that manually activated events may be 
  automatically deactived by their schedules.
