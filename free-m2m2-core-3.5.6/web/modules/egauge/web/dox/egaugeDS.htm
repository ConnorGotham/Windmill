<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This datasource interprets the XML stream specific to eGauge devices. eGauges
are used for many power and other metering purposes. The data stream is described
in the v1.32 revision of the <a href="https://www.egauge.net/docs/egauge-xml-api.pdf" target="_blank">
eGauge XML API</a>.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>The <b>URI</b> is the HTTP path to reach the eGauge. It should take form: 
https://12.34.56.789:555 (note the lack of slash at the end). The <b>Update Period</b> 
determines the interval the URI will be polled. If <b>Query History</b> is checked, 
the data source will send out an inquiry when a gap larger than the <b>History Period</b> and
attempt to get data with resolution of the history period. To protect your system and preserve efficiency, 
the buffer is of fixed size as defined by the <b>History Query Buffer Size</b>, in megabytes. If you receive a JAXB exception,
you may need to increase your buffer size. This is particularly true for very large history queries using the utility, as most
interruptions to regular polling are smaller. <b>Retries</b> and <b>Timeout 
Seconds</b> are HTTP parameters governing retrying the connection and awaiting a response.</p>

<p><b>Totaling Registers</b> determines if totaled and virtual registers computed from physical 
registers should be included in the response. <b>No Team</b> determines if the device should return 
information gathered from devices it coordinates. <b>Team Status</b> includes additional information
about the devices being coordinated. As of version 1.0.0 of the eGauge module, team status is not
meaningfully used. <b>Instantaneous Registers</b> includes computed rate-of-change values in the returned
data.</p>

<p><b>Convert to kWh</b> will automatically transform the readings for Watt-seconds (Joules) to Kilowatt-hours.
This is a simple division operation by a factor of 3.6e6. <b>Interpolate Instantaneous</b> determines if the 
datasource should calculate the power values associated with the stored data energy values during a history query.</p>

<h1>History Query Tool</h1>
<p>The History Query tool works on relative time frames. So, if the <b>history begins</b> 9 weeks ago and the 
<b>relative end</b> is 4 weeks, the last sample will be 4 weeks later than 9 weeks ago, which is 5 weeks ago. Using a
relative end value of 0 will result in getting history up to the current moment. Doing a sequential query will break this
into one week increments for the sake of keeping the requests relatively small. Querying for a very long period can take time.</p>
