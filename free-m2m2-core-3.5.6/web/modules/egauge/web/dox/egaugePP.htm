<p>The <b>Register Name</b> is used to identify register values returned from the
eGauge. <b>Totaling Register</b> is a read-only property expressing if the data point
is a virtual, computed value. The <b>Type</b> determines where to use the accumulated
value or the rate-of-change, instantaneous value in acquiring new values for the datapoint.
The <b>Multiplier</b> is a scaling factor applied to new values. The <b>Offset</b> is added 
to new values. Not that both of these are applied after the conversion to kWh, if the data source
has been configured to perform this conversion.</p>
