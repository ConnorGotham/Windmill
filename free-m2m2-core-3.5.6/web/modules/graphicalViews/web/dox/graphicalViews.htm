<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A Graphical view is similar to a watch list, but instead provides a graphical representation of selected points. Point values and value times update automatically&mdash;you do not need to refresh the page. (In fact, the system operates more efficiently if you don't.)</p>

<h1>Selecting a graphical view</h1>
<p>
  A user may have multiple graphical views, but may only view one at a time. Use the dropdown control to select the 
  view that you wish to display. To create a new view, click the add icon (<img src="images/add.png"/>) in 
  the top right-hand corner of the watch list section. To edit an existing view, click the edit icon 
  (<img src="images/pencil.png"/>). In either case, the <b>Graphical view edit</b> page will be displayed.
</p>

<p>
  You may see graphical views in your list that you did not create. If so, these views were "shared" with you by the 
  person who created them. You will be at least allowed to view them, but you may not be allowed to set values via the
  view if you were not granted "set" permission. If you no longer wish to have the view in your list, use the delete 
  icon (<img src="images/delete.png"/>) to "unshare" the view. (Unsharing does not delete the view.)
</p>

<h1>Background images</h1>
<p>Graphical views may optionally be presented upon background images. Backgrounds can be set in the graphical view editing page.</p>

<h1>Points in graphical views</h1>
<p>A point can belong to multiple graphical views, so you can create views that are as specific as you require.</p>
<p>
  The representation of each point in your view depends upon that point's configuration. Points can be rendered as 
  simply a current value, or an arbitrary icon set can be used that visually represents the point's value. When the 
  user rolls over the point with the mouse, a set of controls will be displayed (unless they have been explicitly 
  suppressed). The actual controls displayed will also depend upon the point's configuration. Hovering over the info 
  icon (<img src="images/information.png"/>) will display the point's current value and last change time. Points that 
  are settable (and for which you have permission to set) will show a set icon (<img src="images/icon_edit.png"/>). 
  Hovering your mouse over this icon will present options for setting the point. Points that are configured for 
  charting will show a chart icon (<img src="images/icon_chart.png"/>). Hovering over this icon will present the 
  current chart. Charts are updated automatically, like values and times, so when new data is available the chart will 
  update itself. If a warning icon (<img src="images/warn.png"/>) is displayed beside a point, it indicates that is 
  inactive, either because it or its data source are disabled. A wait indicator (<img src="images/hourglass.png"/>) 
  means that the point currently has no value, and is likely waiting for its value to be received.
</p>

<h1>Display Only Graphic View</h1>
<p>You can display only the graphic view with nothing else on the page by adding the following parameters to your URL:
 showHeader=false, showToolbar=false, showControls = false, showFooter = false
 Example: http://{mangoHost:mangoPort}/views.shtm?showControls=false&showHeader=false&showToolbar=false&showFooter=false
<p>

<h1>Public Views / Anonymous Users</h1>
<p>The graphical views can expose information and even control elements to anonymous users. To enable, choose an anonymous access level of either read or set. 
Then, to access the view, go to http://{root URL}/public_view.htm?[viewName=XXX || viewId=XXX || viewXid=XXX] as in http://localhost:1234/public_view.htm?viewId=4</p>
