<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Configure access to a Haystack tagging database and poll the data via a Watch.  One watch is 
  created for all the data points on this data source.  The lease time is automatically configured to 
  be 10x the poll period.  Each poll of the data source updates the watch and will retrieve the latest
  value for each of the data points.  Polling too slow will result in missed data, polling too fast is ok as 
  the watch will not return duplicate values.  Note that the timestamp of the returned data is the time of the Mango poll.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<ul>
	<li>quantize - align poll start to a round number of seconds</li>
	<li>uri - http://host/path-to-haystack/ (Can be http or https)</li>
	<li>username - username for Haystack user</li>
	<li>password - password for Haystack user</li>
	<li>connectTimeout - timeout for connection requests in ms (0 for none)</li>
	<li>readTimeout - timeout for read requests in ms (0 for none)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quantize</b> will cause the data source startup to be delayed
  so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th 
  second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately.</p>
