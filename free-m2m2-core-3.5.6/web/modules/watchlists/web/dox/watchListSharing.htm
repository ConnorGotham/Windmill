  Watch lists may be shared with other users. They are not editable by the user with whom you are sharing (although the 
  user does have the right to removed themselves from the share list). To share a watch list that you have created, 
  select the user from the drop down box and click the <img src="images/add.png"/> icon. Then, choose the access type 
  that the user should have, either "read" (not allowed to set points) or "set" (allowed to set points). Add as many 
  shares to the watch list as required. Changes to share settings are automatically saved. To delete a user from the 
  share list, click the <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon associated with the user's row.
