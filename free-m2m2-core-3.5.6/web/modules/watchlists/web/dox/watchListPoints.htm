  This section provides a list of all of the points in the system to which you have access. Your access depends upon 
  your settings within the Users area (<img src="images/user.png"/>). See your administrator if you do not have access 
  to points that you need to see. If you do not have any points (say, because this system is newly installed... 
  welcome!), you can create them by creating Data Sources (<img src="images/icon_ds.png"/>).
</p>
<p>
  Points are arranged in a hierarchy, or tree, as set in the Point hierarchy area 
  (<img src="modules/watchlists/web/folder_brick.png"/>). The hierarchy is entirely arbitrary, and is shared by all 
  users. You must be an administrator to edit the point hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
  To add a point in the hierarchy to your current watch list, click on its name. The arrow icon 
  (<img src="images/bullet_go.png"/>) will fade to indicate that the point is in your current watch list.
