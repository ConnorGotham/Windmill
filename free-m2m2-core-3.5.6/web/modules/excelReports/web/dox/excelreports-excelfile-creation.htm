<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Reports use templated Excel files to fill in areas linked to data points and date ranges.  This document will explain 
  how to setup an Excel file for use in the Excel Reports module.  After the file is uploaded, Mango will extract the necessary information 
  and provide a way to link the ranges to data points and date ranges.
</p>

<h2>Named Ranges</h2>
<p>
  Named ranges are a way to link a cell or group of cells to a name.  This module supports named ranges that are either individual cells,
  column groups or row groups.  Mango data can only be filled in horizontally or vertically.
</p>
<p>
  To create a named range simply select the cells desired and enter a name into the 'Name box' at the left end of the formula bar.
</p>
<p>
  When configuring a template in Mango all named ranges will be available to link to a data point.
</p>
<p>
If a cell in a named range or that a named range expands to already contains a value, that value will only be modified if
there is a value for the point or its rollup at the time corresponding to the cell. Named ranges need not begin on the same row
as their time reference. The nth item in the time reference corresponds to n cells advanced in the named range regardless of direction or
starting position.
<</p>

<h2>Mango Data Available</h2>
<p>
  Mango can insert various types of data into an Excel named range.  Some are single cell while others require a column or row.
</p>
<h3>Single Cell Data</h3>
<p>
  Single cell data can be assigned into cells by creating a named range with a .{data_name} postfix.  For example to insert the XID for a data point one would use 
  the named range<code>voltage.xid</code>.  Then via the Mango template configuration page one can link a data point to a named range of <code>voltage</code>.  This will 
  allow any named range that starts with <code>voltage</code> prefix to be filled in the the available single cell data.  The following are a lists of available single 
  cell data:
</p>

<h4>For any point:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>xid</b> - The XID of the linked point</li>
  <li><b>name</b> - The name of the linked point</li>
  <li><b>deviceName</b> - The device name of the linked point</li>
  <li><b>tags.tagKey</b> - The tags are accessible by replacing "tagKey" with the appropriate key</li> 
</ul>
<h4>For Numeric Points:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>firstValue</b> - The first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>firstTime</b> - The date of the first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastValue</b> - The last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastTime</b> - The date of the last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>minimumValue</b> - The statistical minimum value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>minimumTime</b> - The date of the statistical minimum value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>maximumValue</b> - The statistical maximum value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>maximumTime</b> - The date of the statistical maximum value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>average</b> - The statistical average value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>integral</b> - The statistical integral value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>sum</b> - The statistical sum of the time period</li>
  <li><b>count</b> - The count of samples within the time period</li>
  <li><b>delta</b> - The statistical delta of the values in the time period</li>
</ul>

<h4>For Binary and Multistate Points:</h4>
<p>Note that there are also a Multiple Cell area for the Starts and Runtimes list. 
<ul>
  <li><b>firstValue</b> - The first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>firstTime</b> - The date of the first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastValue</b> - The last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastTime</b> - The date of the last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>count</b> - The count of samples within the time period</li>
</ul>

<h4>For Alphanumeric Points:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>firstValue</b> - The first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>firstTime</b> - The date of the first value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastValue</b> - The last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>lastTime</b> - The date of the last value of the time period</li>
  <li><b>count</b> - The count of samples within the time period</li>
  <li><b>changes</b> - The number of changes within the time period</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Cell Data</h3>
<p>
  Multiple cell data can be assigned into cells by creating a named range of multiple cells in a column or row.  Mango will overwrite 
  any data in the range and also expand the range to fit the report data.  This means that no cells below a column range or to 
  the right of a row range should be used in your template as they may be overwritten.  Mango will copy the cell style when it fills down. 
</p>

<h4>Point Timestamps</h4>
<p>
  The point timestamps can optionally be written into a named range. Point timestamp named range 
  should be group of cells in a column or row.  The named range is assigned to a Time Series on the template configuration page
</p>

<h4>Point Values</h4>
<p>Point values can optionally be assigned to a column or row named range.</p>


<h4>Binary and Multistate Points</h4>
<p>A table of starts and runtimes can be filled in for these points, the available ranges are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>starts</b> - The number of times this state happened in the period</li>
  <li><b>runtime</b> - The total duration of this state in the period</li>
  <li><b>proportion</b> - The proportion to the total time that was spent in this state</li>
  <li><b>startsAndRuntimeValue</b> - The value of the state</li>
</ul>

<h2>Referenced Formula Expansion</h2>
<p>Mango will search for and expand any ranges that contain formulas that reference ranges that are assigned to the template.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Basic support for events is provided.  To include events for all data points in the report you can define named ranges that will be populated by any matching 
events within the Series start and finish times.  If you choose to define any of the listed named ranges a query will be done on the Events table which will incur some performance hit. 
A list of the optional range names is here:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>eventsDeviceName</b> - The device name for the point in the event. (String)</li>
	<li><b>eventsPointName</b> -  The name for the point in the event. (String)</li>
	<li><b>eventsLevel</b> -  Level of event. (String)</li>
	<li><b>eventsTime</b> - Time of event creation. (Date)</li>
	<li><b>eventsMessage</b> - Message for the event. (String)</li>
	<li><b>eventsStatus</b> - Status of the event. (String)</li>
	<li><b>eventsAcknowledged</b> - Has the event been acknowledged. (Boolean)</li>
	<li><b>eventsDuration</b> - Duration that the event was active. (Integer milliseconds)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
  Use named ranges whenever possible.  This will ensure that any references are retained when the data in inserted and the range expands or retracts. 
  For example the following formula <code>$A$3*$B$4</code> can be expressed by <code>a_range*b_range</code>.  It is also recommended to use named 
  ranges for Chart data and time ranges.
