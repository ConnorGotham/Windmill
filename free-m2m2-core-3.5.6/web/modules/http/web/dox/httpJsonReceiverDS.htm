<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The JSON receiver accepts a few formats of JSON data over HTTP. The <b>receive type</b> is used to switch between these.
By default, receive type "JSON" is selected, which means the data source is expecting a post with a content type application/json.
Type "Parameter" uses the serotonin json library to parse values from json strings set as parameter values in a regular application/text
content type.
</p>
<p>
The JSON variant of the Http Receiver functions in exactly the same way, except it
assumes the data portion of the Http request contains zero or more Json strings,
and is agnostic to the keyset. The "Parameter Name" field of data points
corresponds to their key or a prefix of the key within the JSON object from 
which to draw value. 
</p> 
<p>
If your receive type is JSON, then the Jackson JSON library is used to get the value described by the parameter name as a
Jackson JSON pointer. You can find this specification here: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03">
IETF JSON pointer</a>. In brief, pointers begin with leading slashes and index lists the same, so in:
</p>

<code>
{ "foo": ["bar", "fish"] }
</code>

<p>
/foo/0 resolves to bar
