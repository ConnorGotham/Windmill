<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This data source is used to collect generic information from the web sites available on the internet, or internal 
  equipment available on an intranet. Using mechanisms similar to a web browser, the data source requests information 
  from HTTP-enabled devices, and then uses Regular Expressions to extract the desired information. This is a polling 
  data source.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the HTTP request is made. The <b>URL</b> is the address of the page that is to be parsed. Use the 
  <img src="images/bullet_go.png"/> icon to test the URL. (Opens in a new window or browser tab.)
</p>

<p>
  Checking <b>Quantize</b> will cause the data source startup to be delayed
  so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th 
  second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately. The <b>Timeout</b> and <b>Retries</b> fields 
  determine the system behaviour in the case of a polling failure. The data source waits the given number of timeout 
  milliseconds for a response from the equipment. If it is not received the request will be retried the given number of 
  times.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Timeout</b> and <b>Retry</b> fields determine how long to wait for the web server to return the page, and how 
  many times to retry the connection in the event of failures. If all of the retries are exhausted, a data source 
  exception event is raised.
