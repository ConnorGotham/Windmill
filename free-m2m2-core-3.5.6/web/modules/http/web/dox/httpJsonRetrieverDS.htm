<p>The <b>Data type</b> is the Mango representation of the value. Received data is automatically converted to the required data type.  The <b>Value pointer</b> determines where in the returned content to find the point value. See the Jackson JSON pointer documentation. In brief, properties are separated by slashes and
list indices are treated as properties. So, /entries/4/value is the value property of the fourth item in the entries list.</p>

<p>For the binary data type, the <b>Binary 0 value</b> can be defined. If the value found in the content matches it, the point will be updated with 0. Otherwise, the point is updated with 1. For the numeric data type a <b>Number format</b> can be defined, which provides information on how the text value found by the RegEx should be parsed. See the "Number formats" documentation for more information.</p>

<p>A <b>Time pointer</b> can be defined to locate the value's time stamp in the returned content. If a time pointer is defined, a <b>Time format</b> must also be entered, which provides information on how the text time found by the pointer should be parsed. See the "Date/time formats" documentation for more information.</p>
