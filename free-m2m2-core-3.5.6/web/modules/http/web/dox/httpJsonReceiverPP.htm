<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The JSON variant of the HTTP data point contains two additional fields: the 
device identifier key and the device identifier itself. These are formed from
the use case where a device publishes its name in the JSON object, i.e. 
"id":"eGauge42", where "id" is the key and "eGauge42" is the identifier. The
other properties are inherited from the HTTP Receiver data point properties. If 
the device identifier key is left blank, the receiver will behave as though every 
JSON object corresponds to the point.
</p>
<p>
If you're using receive type 2, then you can also specify a Jackson JSON path to a number of milliseconds epoch timestamp.
The device identifier key, parameter name, and timestamp key are all Jackson JSON paths within the received Json object.
