<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The MBus data source will poll MBus devices to collect sensor information.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the MBus equipment is polled for data. Checking <b>Quantize</b> will cause the data source startup to be delayed
  so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th 
  second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Bit/s</b> dropdown determines ???
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Response Timeout(ms)</b> setting determines how long the data source will wait for a response before aborting the request.</p>
<p>
  The <b>TCP/IP Connection</b> radio button allows to choose a TCP/IP connection to the device.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Direct serial connection</b> radio button allows to choose a serial connection to the device.
