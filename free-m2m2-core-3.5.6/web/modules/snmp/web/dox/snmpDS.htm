<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The SNMP data source is used to gather data from device that implement the SNMP protocol. This data source performs 
  polling and also accepts SNMP traps.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the SNMP points will be polled for data. The remainder of the fields are needed to configure the details of SNMP 
  communication.
</p>
<p>
  Setting <b>Maximum vars per request</b> to a value greater than 0 will partition requests into vars of the given size.
  A value of 0 implies no partitioning; all vars will be sent in a single request. 
</p>

<h1>SNMP host testing</h1>
<p>
  The host testing can be used to test both the data source configuration and the existence and value of a given OID 
  (Object IDentifier). Enter the OID to test and click "Get OID value". The current configuration settings will be used 
  to sent an SNMP get request. If successful, the OID value will be displayed. Otherwise, a message describing the error 
  will be provided.
</p>

<h1>Community</h1>
<p>
  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use <b>community</b> strings as passwords for access. Often there will be a read-only community string
  and a read-write community string, or perhaps write only. Mango will send the write community string with point set value
  actions, and will send the read community string while polling.
