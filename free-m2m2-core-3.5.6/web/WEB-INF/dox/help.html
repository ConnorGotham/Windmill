<h1>Overview and Design Concepts</h1>

<h3>Navigation Overview</h3>
<p>Functionality in this application is primarily accessed using the controls in the header. Depending on the 
permissions granted to your user account, you will see various icons underneath the application logo. When you hover
over these icons with your mouse, you will see an overlay message with a short description of what the icon is 
for.</p>
<p>Beside the header controls, at the right-hand side of the header, is the username of the user who is currently 
logged in, with buttons to define that user's home page and to log out.</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>Data Sources are fundamental to the operation of this application. A <b>Data Source</b> is a "place" from which 
data is received. Virtually anything can be a Data Source, insofar as the communications protocol is supported by the
application. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a Modbus network accessible via RS232, RS485, TCP/IP, or UDP/IP, you can create a Modbus Data 
  Source that will poll the network for data on an interval you can define.</li>
  <li>If you have equipment or an application that can send data over HTTP you can start an HTTP Receiver Data Source
  that will listen for incoming connections and route the data to the appropriate points.</li>
  <li>For hardware that supports SNMP, start an SNMP Data Source. Values can be polled on an interval schedule, or 
  traps can be received for report-on-exception.</li>
  <li>Data can be read and updated in a SQL data base external to the system.</li>
  <li>Data can be generated either randomly or predictively using a Virtual Data Source.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data values that are received or collected by a Data Source are stored within Data Points. Every Data Source has a 
contextual help button that explains the properties necessary to configure the Data Source, as well as general descriptions 
and any caveats.</p>

<h3>Data Points</h3>
<p>A <b>Data Point</b> is a collection of associated historical values. For example, a particular point might be a 
temperature reading from a room, while another point could be the humidity reading from the same room. Points can 
also be control values, such as a switch to turn a piece of equipment on or off.</p>
<p>There are many attributes that are used to control the behavior of points, but can be separated into two groups. First, there is the concept of a 
<b>Point Locator</b>. Locators are used by Data Source to determine how to "find" the data for the particular point.
For instance, the Point Locator of an SQL Data Point indicates the table and field names with which to find its specific value from the query.</p>
<p>Second, Data Point attributes also determine many other aspects of the point, such as its name, how/when it should be logged into the database, 
how long to keep logged data, how to render values for display, and how to chart values. These attributes are common to all Data Points, although 
a particular data type may or may not have them all.</p>
<p>You can also configure Data Points with <b>Event Detectors</b>, which are used to detect conditions of interest 
in points' values, such as the value being too high/low for too long, changing too often, not changing at often enough, etc.</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>There are five supported data types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Binary</b> values have only two states, referred to in the system as the <b>zero</b> value
  and the <b>one</b> value. You can use a Text Renderer to convert the display of binary values to whatever alternate
  labels you need, such as "on/off", "high/low", "started/stopped", etc.</li>
  <li><b>Multistate</b> values have multiple distinct states. Values are primitively represented as integers (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 7, ...), 
  but also have Text Renderer options to convert these values to appropriate textual representations such as "on/off/disabled",
  "cool/heat/off", or anything else.</li>
  <li><b>Numeric</b> values are decimal values represented in the system with a floating point variable. 
  Temperature, humidity, price, and altitude are examples of numeric values. Text Renderers can be used to determine
  display features like how many decimals places to display, whether to separate thousands (with commas or dots), and 
  whether a suffix should be displayed (e.g. &deg;F, kW/h, moles, etc). The "Range" type of Text Renderer can be used to convert ranges
  of numeric values into text labels.</li>
  <li><b>Alphanumeric</b> values are simply strings of characters, such as the O/S description of an SNMP source.</li>
  <li><b>Image</b> values are binary representations of image data. They are stored in files on the host file system
  (i.e. not in the database) and are cached in memory as necessary for performance purposes. Renderers can be used to
  create scaled images - such as thumbnails - for presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Monitoring of points within the system can be done in a few ways. You can use the <b>Watch List</b> to dynamically
create tabular lists of points including their values, last update times, and charts of historical information (if 
the point is configured to support this). Values and charts are updated in real time without having to refresh your
browser window. Charts of multiple points can also be displayed on demand.</p>
<p>Mango has a RESTful API which can be used to build custom integrations or monitoring applications. The <b>Custom Dashboards</b>
module offers an AngularJS library to make using the REST API easier for HTML5 implementations of dashboards, as well as several tutorials.
Information on possible API endpoints is available by setting swagger.enabled=true in your env.properties file, then navigating
to &lt;mango&gt;/swagger in a browser. More information on both JavaScript and REST APIs is available on the Wiki.</p>
<p>You can also create <b>Graphical Views</b> of points using drag and drop functionality to position graphical 
representations of points on an arbitrary background image. Animated images can be used to create highly dynamic 
visualization of system behaviour, and, like the watch lists, values are updated in real time without a browser 
refresh. These views can subsequently be marked as "public" to be reused on public web sites.</p>
<p>Automatic monitoring is possible through the script engines in both the <b>Meta Data Source</b> and <b>Scripting 
Data Source</b> setting values to a point with Event Detectors for the conditions being watch for, as with creating 
a Multistate Meta Data Point with configured Event Detectors and Event Handlers. As Mango Automation is fundamentally 
modular and largely opensource, automatic monitoring of every aspect of Mango Automation is available to be encoded.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>Control of external systems can is achieved through points which are "settable" (aka writable or output). A 
<b>settable</b> point can be set to a user-defined value, such as a thermostat setting or equipment control switch.
Both watch lists and graphical views provide simple means by which to input a value to set. The Point Locator for a
settable point determines how the Data Source sets the value within the external equipment.</p>
<p>You can also use the <b>Scripting Data Source</b> to write control logic to automatically write values to any settable point.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
  An <b>Event</b> is the occurrence of a defined condition within the system. Both system-defined and user-defined 
  events are available. System-defined events include Data Source operation errors, user logins, and system 
  startup/shutdown. User-defined events include Point Event Detectors (see "Event Detectors" above), and events defined
  in modules. There are also "audit events", which are raised when users make changes (additions, modifications, 
  deletions) to runtime-affecting objects including Data Sources, Data Points, Point Event Detectors, Event Handlers,
  and many events defined by modules.
</p>
<p>
  Once an Event has been detected, it is acted upon by handlers. An <b>Event Handler</b> is a user-defined behavior
  that is to be performed upon the raising of a particular event, such as sending an email or setting the value of a 
  settable point.
</p>
<p>An <b>Alarm</b> is an Event with an alarm level. When your application has (an) unacknowledged alarm(s), you will see
 a flag icon (<img src="images/flag_white.png"/>) and an associated description (or count) near the center of the header area. 
 The color of the icon(s) will indicate the severity of the alarm(s). The levels of alarm are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><img src="images/flag_grey.png"> None</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_blue.png"> Information</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_aqua.png"> Important</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_green.png"> Warning</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_yellow.png"> Urgent</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_orange.png"> Critical</li>
  <li><img src="images/flag_red.png"> Safety</li>
</ul>
<p>You can click on the icon or the description to go to the list of active alarms.</p>

<h3>Graphic Dashboards</h3>

<p>Mango Automation has four modules for creating graphic representations of your data:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Custom Dashboards</strong> offers folders that are automatically hosted securely through Mango and use Mango's AngularJS directives atop our API
 to accelerate producing quality dashboards. This module contains many example dashboards with the source code that produced them. A section of our forum is 
 dedicated to answering questions, posting tutorials, and posting example code, located at 
 <a href="http://infiniteautomation.com/forum/category/21/mango-api-and-dashboards">infiniteautomation.com/forum/category/21/mango-api-and-dashboards</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Graphic Views</strong> offers a simple way to use images, graphics and animations to create dashboards and HMIs. 
With drag and drop simplicity, you quickly get your page online.</li></ul>
