  UI performance represents the responsiveness of the user interface. This includes all activities that are managed via
  the long poll mechanism, such as the maximum alarm level indicator, AJAX updating, event list updates, etc. If
  the Mango host has a limited-power CPU, you may want to set the UI performance to a lower level to prevent users 
  browsers from consuming too much of the hosts CPU.
