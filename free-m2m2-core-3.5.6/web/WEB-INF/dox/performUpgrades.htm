<p>Mango provides tools to download and update your Mango Automation instance. Our server will provide you
a list of the latest modules, and this manifest is presented for your review before downloading. You are also presented with 
the option to perform a system backup automatically as part of the upgrading process. This automatic backup will save your H2/MySQL database
and your JSON configuration to your specified directory. These locations are configurable on the systems settings page sections <b>Configuration 
Backup Settings</b> and <b>H2/MySQL Database Backup Settings</b>.

<p>If <b>Restart after download</b> is checked in the Advanced Options, which it is by default, your instance of Mango will restart after it finishes 
the downloads to finish the upgrade process.</p>
