  Site analytics are used to track various statistics about your Mango pages.  There are 2 
  places that HTML or script tags can be inserted into Mango's pages.  The first is just before 
  the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag and the second is just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.  The contents of 
  these will be placed at the corresponding location of <b>every</b> page in Mango.  When left blank, nothing is inserted.
</p>
<p>
These tags can also be used to reference a javascript file or resource placed into Mango's web directory under your MA_HOME location.
An example would be:
<br>
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/customScript.js"&gt;&lt;script/&gt;  
</code>
<br>
Where the file customScript.js is placed directly into the MA_HOME/web folder.
</p>

<p><b>Note: </b> it is important that you test the inserted tags after saving the settings by clicking the test button.  Since 
the tags are applied to every page if you make a mistake it could cause all pages to fail to load.  The test button will open a window 
that loads the data point details page with the new tags inserted, verify that it loads correctly.  The tags are <b>not</b> applied to 
the system settings page for this reason.
