<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  <b>Users</b> represent individuals who use the system. Various privileges can be assigned to users to grant them the 
  ability to read and alter data and system behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  There are two basic user levels: administrators (<img src="images/user_suit.png"/>), and other users 
  (<img src="images/user_green.png"/>). Administrators have access to all system functionality. Other users have 
  various privileges based upon permission configuration.
</p>

<h1>Editing users</h1>
<p>
  To add a new user, click the <img src="images/user_add.png"/> icon. The user will not actually be added until it is 
  successfully saved. To edit an existing user, click the user's name in the "Users" list.
</p>
<p>
  Passwords are not retrievable once they have been saved; they can only be reset by specifying a new password.
</p>
<p>
  A disabled user is not allowed to log in. To delete a user, click the <img src="images/delete.png"/> icon.
</p>
<p>
  To test a user's email address, click the <img src="images/email_go.png"/> icon. This will cause an email to be sent 
  to the specified email address.
</p>
<p>
  Users may have alarm notification emails sent to their email addresses without explicitly being specified on an email 
  event handler. Selecting a <b>Send alarm emails</b> alarm level above "Ignore" will cause these notifications to be 
  sent when the event's alarm level is greater than or equal to the user's minimum alarm level, but only when the event 
  is raised (i.e. no escalation or inactive notifications). Note also that if the user is already specified on an email 
  event handler, they will not be sent multiple emails.
</p>
<p>
  Users may receive emails from their own audit trail by checking the <b>Receive own audit events</b>. Note that only
  audit events at or above the user's <b>Send alarm emails</b> setting will be emailed. Audit events would be emailed 
  to all other users who have elected to receive event emails at or below the level of the event.
</p>
<h1>User privileges</h1>
<p>The <b>Permissions</b> group 'superadmin' determines if a user is an <b>Administrator</b>.</p>
<p>
  If the user is not an administrator, the <b>Permissions</b> field determines what access to various areas of Mango
  the user has. The field contains a comma-delimited list of virtual "groups" to which the user belongs. If the user
  should have access to, for example, data source management, then at least one of the groups in the data source 
  management permission list (see System Settings) needs to match at least one of the groups in the user's list.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking on the <img src="images/bullet_down.png"/> will present a list of permission groups that other users have,
  but the current user does not. Clicking on a group name will add it to the current user's group list. The user must
  still be saved for the permissions to persist.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the virtual group names are case-sensitive.
