  Use the "purge point data" settings to determine the default purge settings for data point history data. These 
  settings may be overridden at the data source level, which may be further overridden at the point level.
</p>

<p>
  Use the various Purge settings to set the maximum age of an event of that given type before it is purged from the database. Purging 
  permanently deletes the event as well as any user comments associated with it.  
  
  Alarm levels are configurable for all event types.  For example some Data Source events may have the 'urgent' level and by setting the 'urgent' purge setting to 1 day 
  and the data source events purge setting to 1 week these events will be purged after 1 day.  This will not purge Data Source events that are not 'urgent'.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Data Point Events are from setting or enable/disable of a point</li>
    <li>Data Source Events are from enable/disable or errors for a data source.</li>
    <li>System Events include system startup/shutdown </li>
    <li>Publisher Events are from enable/disable or errors for a publisher.</li>
    <li>Audit Events are from changing the settings of a point/publisher/data source.</li>
  </ul>

  Use the "purge events" settings to set the maximum age of an event before it is purged from the database. Purging 
  permanently deletes the event as well as any user comments associated with it.

<p>
  Click the <b>Purge all data</b> button to permanently delete all point samples currently in the database. This can be
  useful for giving a Mango instance a "fresh start", especially if spurious data exists from configuration and set up
  activities.

<p>
  Click the <b>Purge now using point settings</b> button to permanently delete events and point values in the database according to these settings. This can be
  useful for giving a Mango instance a "fresh start", especially if spurious data exists from configuration and set up
  activities. 
</p>


<p>
  User the "Discard point values future dated" settings to set the maximum amount of time into the future for which 
  data points will accept new values. Any values with timestamps that exceed this value will be discarded, and an error
  message will be written to the log.
