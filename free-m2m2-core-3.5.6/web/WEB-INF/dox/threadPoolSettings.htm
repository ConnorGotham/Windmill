<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Mango processes units of work referred to as 'work items'.  There are 3 priority levels for the work items: low, medium, and high. When a work item is processed it is assigned to 
a thread pool corresponding to its priority.
</p>
<h2>High Priority Thread Pool</h2>
<p>Mango's high priority pool is the only pool that can grow and shrink dynamically. The <b>core pool size</b> is the number of threads that will remain around to process work.  If more work is required to be done than 
there are threads in the pool, Mango will create new threads up to <b>maximum pool size</b>.  When the maximum pool size threads have been reached, work will be discarded.  It is important for large systems to configure their 
thread pools properly because too large of a pool can cause system crashes while too small may not be able to perform all work.  
</p>

<h3>High Priority Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data Source Polls</li>
<li>BACnet device polling</li>
<li>Database batch writes</li>
<li>Event Handler Processes</li>
<li>Setting a data point's value</li>
<li>Http Image Retriever</li>
</ul>

<h2>Low and Medimum Priority Thread Pools</h2>
<p>These pools begin empty and will grow up to <b>core pool size</b>.  Once the pool has reached its core size it will not grow any larger and the existing threads 
wiil wait in the pool for work.  If not enough threads are availble for the pool to do work, the task will be queued.  This queue can grow unbounded.</p>

<h3>Medium Priority Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Event Notify - When a data point value is saved or updated anything in mango that needs to know about it receives its message via this Work Item </li>
<li>Backup Tasks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Priority Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reports</li>
<li>NoSQL Backups</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>User Event Listeners</li>
</ul>
