<h1>Mango Serial Socket Bridges</h1>
<p>A <b>Serial to socket bridge</b> is a type of virtual serial port that allows Mango to transmit/receive serial data over a TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2>Serial client settings </h2>
<p> The bridge acts as a client that will connect to an open TCP/IP port on a host.  The bridge will show up with the <b>Serial port id</b> in the Comm port listings for applicable data sources.
By setting the <b>host</b> and <b>port</b> Mango will attempt to open up a TCP/IP socket and transmit data and receive messages. The <b>timeout</b> setting is referred to as the SO_TIMEOUT 
and is the timeout in milliseconds that Mango will wait during read operations.  The timeout cannot be less than 0 and a timeout of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout. 
</p>
<h2>Serial server settings </h2>
<p> The bridge acts as a server that will accept TCP/IP connections on the local host's port.  The bridge will show up with the <b>Serial port id</b> in the Comm port listings for applicable data sources.
By setting the <b>port</b> Mango will attempt to open up a TCP/IP server socket and wait for incoming connections. The <b>timeout</b> setting is referred to as the SO_TIMEOUT 
and is the timeout in milliseconds that Mango will wait during read operations.  The timeout cannot be less than 0 and a timeout of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout. 
The <b>Buffer Size</b> setting determines how much the socket will read before transmitting onto the serial port.
