<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This page provides a fast way to apply <b>set</b> and <b>read</b> permissions to data points.  Data point groups can be filtered by creating 
filters to find desired points.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Filter</h2>
<p>
Filters are applied if the <b>Filter State</b> column is set to anything besides <i>Disabled</i>.  Multiple filters can be applied at the same time. Items in the results 
will match all enabled filters. Filter allow pattern matching of strings and can use either % or * as wildcards, as well as a prefix of '^' for NOT, all other characters are treated as is.
Using the value <i>null</i> will match null values, but using the value <i>*null*</i> will match a string that contains the text 'null'.
</p>
<p>
Each Filter row can be applied as a boolean <i>And</i> or a boolean <i>Or</i> by setting the <b>Filter State</b> accordingly.  
<i>And</i> operations require a point to match all of the required filter parameters of that filter.  <i>Or</i> operators allow matching only one 
of the enabled filter parameters.  Additionally the filter row can be applied using inverse criteria by selecting <i>Not And</i> or <i>Not Or</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disabled</b> no columns of the filter are applied</li>
<li><b>And</b> requires the point to match all columns of the filter</li>
<li><b>Or</b> requires the point to match one column of the filter</li>
<li><b>Not And</b> applies a not condition to all columns, then requires the point to match all columns of the filter</li>
<li><b>Not Or</b> applies a not condition to all columns, then requires the point to match one column of the filter</li>
</ul>

<p>Each <b>filter parameter</b> can be disabled or enabled for the current request by checking the check box in the column header.  
Disabling the parameter excludes it from the query entirely. To edit the value of the filter parameter, click in the cell 
for the corresponding filter and start typing.  Hitting <i>enter</i> will close the editor and update the filter results.  
Filter cells <b>cannot</b> be edited if their column is disabled.
</p>

<p>Note: When applying a <b>Not And</b> or <b>Not Or</b> condition be careful when using the '^' prefix for NOT as it will be ignored and not result in a double <b>not</b> condition.</p>

<h2>Applying Permissions</h2>
<p>
Permissions can be applied by adding one or more groups separated by commas into the box and then clicking <b>Apply permissions</b>.  To clear all permissions for the 
points in view click the <b>Clear permissions</b> button.  Permissions will not be applied twice and trailing commas will be removed.  The total number of data points 
whose permissions are modified will be returned.  For example if your filter shows 10 points but 5 of them already have the permission 'user' then applying the permission 
'user' to that filter group will only modify the 5 points without that permission.
