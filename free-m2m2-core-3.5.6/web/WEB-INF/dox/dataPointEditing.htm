  This page provides controls for editing the properties of a point. The <img src="images/icon_comp.png"/> icon 
  provides a link to the read-only point details page; it is visible only for points that have been saved.
</p>
<p>
  The data source name is provided for reference. The <img src="images/icon_ds_edit.png"/> icon is a link to the data 
  source editing page where the value locator configuration can be found, and is provided as a convenience.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Point name</b> is required, and can be any text value. This name will be used as the visual identifier for the 
  point throughout the system.
</p>
<p>
  Often, the point name is supplemented with the <b>Device name</b> when it is shown in lists with other points. The
  two together are referred to as the "extended point name". The device name is initially defaulted to the data source
  name, but can be changed. The two together allow a point to be uniquely identified in an instance, especially in cases
  where there are multiple points with the same name.
</p>
<p>
  Point permissions are a comma-delimited list of virtual "group" names that are conferred the associated permission.
  <b>Read permission</b> allows the user to view the point various places, including the data point details page.
  <b>Set permission</b> allows the user to set the value of a settable point.
</p>
<p>
  You can specify a <b>Unit</b> for a point. Type in the symbol for the unit e.g. kg, L, mA, Hz, lb.
  Note that for some units there are multiple ways of entering the unit, e.g. for degrees celsius you can enter &deg;C or
  Celsius, for ohms you can use &Omega; or Ohm. Also remember that there are sometimes multiple definitions of a unit, e.g. there are metric tonnes (t),
  short tons (ton_us) and long tons (ton_uk). You can use all SI prefixes on SI units, e.g. you can enter W for watt
  and also &micro;W (microwatt), MW (megawatt) etc.</p>

  For SI Units see the list here <a href='http://jscience.org/api/javax/measure/unit/SI.html' target='blank'>here</a>.
  <br>
  For NonSI Units see the list <a href='http://jscience.org/api/javax/measure/unit/NonSI.html' target='blank'>here</a>.
  <br>
  Note that there are also some units internally defined in this system:
  <ul>
    <li>btu - British thermal unit</li>
    <li>thm - Thermal Unit (BTU * 100000)</li>
    <li>psi - Pounds per square inch</li>
    <li>rpm - Revolutions per minute</li>
    <li>ppm - Part per million</li>
    <li>ppb - Part per billion</li>
  </ul>
    
    There are also some aliases for common units defined here:
  <ul>
    <li>Celsius - &deg;C</li>
    <li>Fahrenheit - &deg;F</li>
  </ul>

<p>  
  Units can also be constructed as an expression of units, such as expressing the units of acceleration m/s^2 or a unit of
  surface loss m^2/s. Kilowatt hours is special: while kW*h would be the means of building it, <b>kWh</b> is the standard suffix
  and both are supported units. Similarly, gal/min is more simply labeled <b>gpm</b> in common practice, and both are accepted units.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Displayed unit</b> specifies which unit the renderer should convert to for display (if supported by the renderer).
  Input format is the same as for Unit. 
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Integral unit</b> used in the display of statistic and specifies which unit the integrated total should be
  displayed in. Input format is the same as for Unit.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Chart color</b> is the default color of the point's line in images charts of multiple points. Color values 
  can be an HTML-style hex, or any color name in the HTML specification. For example, "#2468AC", "red", and 
  "dodgerblue" are all valid values. 
</p>
<p>
  The point can influence its default charting through a <b>Rollup</b> which will plot that statistical metric when
  a rollup of 'Point default' is requested. A rollup has a <b>Rollup period</b> and a <b>Rollup period type</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Both rollups and raw data sets can also be put through the Simplify algorithm. Data sets can aspire to have a certain resulting
  number of values, or provide a magnitude for what is significant. While this can take more resources and time to
  get the data set, the data set should have its minor variances simplified. A point set to simplify either to a target or a
  tolerance it will use the <b>Simplify argument</b> for that value.
</p>
<p>
  Data points can restrict outgoing set values with the <b>Prevent extreme sets</b> option. This allows the admin to specify an upper and
  lower bound for a point's values, such that an operator cannot set a value out to the device that is either below the <b>Low set limit</b>
  or above the <b>High set limit</b>.
